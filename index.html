      <h1>Background - The 2016 Election</h1>
      <h3>Donald Trump's Victory  </h3>
      <h4>The 2016 US Presidential Election marked a turning point in American politics. For the first time, a political outsider was elected to the nation's highest office. Donald Trump's surprise victory over Hillary Clinton shocked people across the political spectrum for both its unprecedentedness and improbability. Donald Trump's lack of political experience, inflamatory rhetoric, and nearly continuous scandals had led many pundits to declare that Hillary Clinton would easily triumph. After his upset victory, experts began to focus more intensely on Trump voters and why they voted for him. Common explanations cite a decline in manufacturing employment, increasing economic inequality, immigration concerns, and nationalism as reasons for Trump's victory.Trump's campaign slogan "Make America Great Again" has come to stand for many of these ideas, at least in the minds of his supporters.</h4>

      <h1>From 'Great' to 'Great Again'</h1>
      <h3>What is meant by 'Great Again'?</h3>
      <h4>The phrase 'Make America Great Again' is now synonomous with Donald Trump. To his supporters, it encapsulates the idea that America has declined from its peak and that with the right leadership, it could again become a dominant world power where citizens could expect substantial increases in quality of life. To Trump opponents, the phrase conotes the racism and sexism of America's past. Trump himself has stated that in his mind, America was great "after World War 1 and in the 1950's". This project looks at his catch phrase and attempts to understand what it might mean to Trump voters. Where the places where they live better in the 1950's than they are now? In what ways?</h4>
