      <h2>Donald Trump's Victory</h2>
      <h4>The 2016 US Presidential Election marked a turning point in American politics. For the first time, a political outsider was elected to the nation's highest office. Donald Trump's surprise victory over Hillary Clinton shocked people across the political spectrum for both its unprecedentedness and improbability. Donald Trump's lack of political experience, inflamatory rhetoric, and nearly continuous scandals had led many pundits to declare that Hillary Clinton would easily triumph. After his upset victory, experts began to investigate Trump voters and why they voted for him. Common explanations cite a decline in manufacturing employment, increasing economic inequality, immigration concerns, and nationalism as reasons for Trump's victory.Trump's campaign slogan "Make America Great Again" has come to stand for many of these ideas, at least in the minds of his supporters.</h4>

      <h2>What Does'Great Again!' Actually Mean To Voters?</h2>
      <h4>To Trump's supporters, the phrase "Make American Great Again!" encapsulates the idea that America has declined from its peak and that with the right leadership, it could again become a dominant world power where citizens could expect substantial increases in quality of life. To Trump opponents, the phrase conotes the racism and sexism of America's past. Trump himself has stated that in his mind, America was great "after World War 1 and in the 1950's". Survey results suggest that most voters view either the 1950's or the 1980's as American's 'Greatest' period.</h4>

      <h4>In general, America appears to have improved from 1950 till 2015. In fact, these 5 pro-Trump counties have improved more in terms of , relative to pro-Hilary counties, because they all had a lower starting point than pro-Hilary counties. 

      Pro-Trump counties have a higher level of education and on average, a lower rate of unemployment rate. A striking difference between the two sets of counties is their population densities, which are much higher for pro-Hilary counties, indicating that the rural-urban divide is very real. Based on the data above, it seems that contrary to an Trump’s campaign slogan, America is at its greatest now, and is doing better than it was in the 1950s, ‘80s, or 90’s. 

      With regards to the 2016 presidential election, this analysis does not provide conclusive evidence for the ideas behind the slogan ‘Make America Great Again!’. Perhaps, in his campaign, the President tapped into something that the data analysed here cannot explain. Deeper or more psycho-analytic research is needed to explain the widespread popularity of his slogan, and ultimately, his election victory.
